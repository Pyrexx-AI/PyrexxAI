            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The healthcare industry has been historically underserved by modern technology. While other sectors adopted seamless automation, medical clinics were left with disjointed EMR systems, expensive after-hours answering services, and overwhelmed front-desk staff.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
              We built PyrexxAI not as a DIY software tool, but as a dedicated technical partner. When you partner with us, we map your exact clinical workflows, custom-train conversational language models on your procedures, and build secure, HIPAA-compliant API bridges directly into your scheduling software. We handle the technical complexity so you can focus on patient care.
